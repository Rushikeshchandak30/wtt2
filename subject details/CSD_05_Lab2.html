        The key technology of the information age is global communication. Web technology is a truly global area of study as it enables global communication with the help of websites. Web technologies are the backbone of all IT infrastructures and their applications in the world. These technologies and applications often emerge in communication within countries and spread rapidly around the world. The main objective of the course is to present the basic web technology concepts that are required for developing web applications. The key technology components are descriptive languages, server-side program elements, and client-side program elements. In addition, the course provides specific content that is beneficial for developing web-based solutions, like relational database communication basics and information security principles and approaches. Most of the jobs available in the IT industries are web technology-related.

        Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in areas of their choice and strengths. Along with course-based projects, the curriculum can be enriched with semester-long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve socially relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various socially relevant domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy, and Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan. To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select relevant online courses and acquire skills from numerous sources under the guidance of faculty and enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project-centric learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modern world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if students are prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. Project-centric learning will also redefine the role of the teacher as a mentor in the learning process. The PCL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question, challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve. It brings students not only to know, understand and remember, but it takes them to analyze, design, and apply categories of Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy.
